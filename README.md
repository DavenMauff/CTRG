## TODO's
### Analysis
1. Brief Description
2. What are we seeing? 
   * Expanding upon features of the graph and it's data
   * Desctibe an overview of the limitations within out data (raw) and therefore our output
3. Justifying Category Choice 
   * This can be done by either invalidating a category or validating a category to yield positive results for the research paper
    * Categories can be invalidated also by a predefined threshold (~5%) to which a skills gap is not likely to occuer
4. Analyzing & Explaining Skills Gap
   * This can be analyzed in the scope of problems this may or may not yield for the country in the future 
   * Not all articles need to be peer-reviewed (e.g. news)
